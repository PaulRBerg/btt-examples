# BTT Examples

A collection of examples for [Branching Tree Technique](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1682346315806539776), which
is a simple specification framework for writing structured Solidity tests.

The first step is to define a tree structure in a `.tree` file. Then, use
[Bulloak](https://github.com/alexfertel/bulloak) to scaffold a skeleton Solidity file. Finally, write your tests!
